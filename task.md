   - **Libraries:** 
     - `react-router-dom`
     - `@mui/material` (Material-UI for design)
   
4. **Document Creation Form**
   - **Files Needed:**

     - Update `src/pages/Home.js` to include form dialog
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create DocumentForm component with fields:
        - Document name (required)
        - Document type (dropdown: Word, Excel, Text)
        - Description (optional)
     2. Add form validation using react-hook-form
     3. Create Firestore document on form submit with:
        - name
        - type 
        - owner (current user ID)
        - createdAt timestamp
        - lastModified timestamp
     4. Add loading state and error handling
     5. Show success message on completion
   - **Libraries:** 
     - `react-hook-form` for form handling
     - `@mui/material` for form components
     - `firebase/firestore` for database operations

5. **Document Editing Interface**
   - **Files Needed:**
     - `src/components/DocumentEditor.js`
     - Update `src/pages/Home.js` to add editor route
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create DocumentEditor component:
        - Add route in App.js for `/document/:id`
        - Fetch document data from Firestore using document ID
        - Render different editors based on document type:
          - Word/Text: Implement Quill editor
          - Excel: Implement Handsontable
     2. Add save functionality:
        - Auto-save on content changes
        - Update lastModified timestamp
        - Show saving indicator
     3. Add toolbar with formatting options:

    - Set up a way to save versions of the document at certain intervals.
    - Use Firestore or Firebase Storage to store document versions.

13. **Notification System**
    - Send real-time notifications when a user is invited to collaborate or when changes are made.
    - **Libraries:** Firebase Cloud Messaging, `react-toastify`

14. **Access Control and Permissions**
    - Set up roles (e.g., owner, editor, viewer) and control document access based on roles.

    - **Libraries:** `jspdf`, `docx`

18. **Activity Logs and Document History**
    - Track and display a log of changes or edits in each document.
    - **Libraries:** Firebase Firestore for logging

19. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Test real-time updates, file uploads, and video calls thoroughly.
    - Perform usability testing and address any issues with responsiveness or real-time updates.

20. **Deployment and Hosting**
    - Deploy the project on Firebase Hosting or an alternative like Vercel or Netlify.

### Recommended Document Types

- **Word Documents** (rich text editor with styling options like bold, italics, headers, etc.)
- **Excel Sheets** (spreadsheet features for data entry, possibly with simple formulas)
- **Text Files** (plain text with minimal formatting)

This setup provides a balanced combination of functionality and ease of development with Firebase, making it a great tool for real-time collaboration. Let me know if you want a deep dive into any of these tasks!
