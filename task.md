2. **Authentication System**
   - Implement Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google).
   - Create login and signup pages with secure routing.
   - Implement logout feature.
   - Add a common header for navigation in the `components` folder.
   - Call the header in `App.js` to ensure it appears on all pages.
   - **Libraries:** `firebase/auth`, `react-firebase-hooks` 

3. **Home/Dashboard Page**
   - Display a grid or list of all documents owned by or shared with the logged-in user.
   - Include options to create a new document.
   - **Libraries:** `react-router-dom`, `material-ui` (for design)

4. **Document Creation Form**
   - Add a form to create a document, with fields like document name and type (Word, Excel, Text).
   - Store document metadata in Firestore.
   - **Libraries:** `formik` or `react-hook-form` for form handling

5. **Document Editing Interface**
   - Use a rich text editor (e.g., Quill) for Word/Text document types.
   - For Excel documents, integrate a spreadsheet-like editor (e.g., Handsontable).
   - **Libraries:** `react-quill`, `handsontable` for Excel-like editing

6. **Real-Time Document Synchronization**
   - Use Firestore for real-time updates on document edits.
   - Set up real-time listeners to handle collaborative editing.
   - **Libraries:** `firebase/firestore`

7. **Chat Feature within Documents**
   - Implement a chat interface within each document.
   - Use Firestore collections to manage document-specific chat rooms.
   - **Libraries:** `react-chat-widget`, `firebase/firestore`

8. **Video Conferencing Setup with Firebase**
   - Set up video conferencing using Firebase’s WebRTC solutions.
   - Integrate with a third-party video API like Agora or Twilio for simplified video calls.
   - **Libraries:** `twilio` or `agora-rtc-sdk`

9. **User Invitation and Document Sharing**
   - Implement a feature to invite users by email or username.
   - Share access to specific documents by updating permissions in Firestore.
   - **Libraries:** `firebase/firestore`, `material-ui`

10. **Real-Time Presence Indicators**
    - Show indicators for active collaborators on a document.
    - Use Firestore's real-time updates to display online/offline statuses.

11. **File Saving and Exporting**
    - Implement save features for Word, Excel, and Text document types.
    - Use Firebase Storage for storing exported files.
    - **Libraries:** `jspdf` for PDFs, `file-saver`

12. **Document Version Control**
    - Set up a way to save versions of the document at certain intervals.
    - Use Firestore or Firebase Storage to store document versions.

13. **Notification System**
    - Send real-time notifications when a user is invited to collaborate or when changes are made.
    - **Libraries:** Firebase Cloud Messaging, `react-toastify`

14. **Access Control and Permissions**
    - Set up roles (e.g., owner, editor, viewer) and control document access based on roles.
    - **Libraries:** `firebase/firestore`

15. **Responsive Design Implementation**
    - Optimize the layout and styling for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
    - **Libraries:** `material-ui`, `styled-components`

16. **Dark Mode and Theming**
    - Implement dark mode and allow users to toggle between themes.
    - **Libraries:** `material-ui`

17. **PDF and DOCX Export Options**
    - Allow exporting documents as PDF or DOCX.
    - **Libraries:** `jspdf`, `docx`

18. **Activity Logs and Document History**
    - Track and display a log of changes or edits in each document.
    - **Libraries:** Firebase Firestore for logging

19. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Test real-time updates, file uploads, and video calls thoroughly.
    - Perform usability testing and address any issues with responsiveness or real-time updates.

20. **Deployment and Hosting**
    - Deploy the project on Firebase Hosting or an alternative like Vercel or Netlify.

### Recommended Document Types

- **Word Documents** (rich text editor with styling options like bold, italics, headers, etc.)
- **Excel Sheets** (spreadsheet features for data entry, possibly with simple formulas)
- **Text Files** (plain text with minimal formatting)

This setup provides a balanced combination of functionality and ease of development with Firebase, making it a great tool for real-time collaboration. Let me know if you want a deep dive into any of these tasks!
